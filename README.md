**CUSANI** is a Software that identifies vehicles and pedestrians on synthetically images recorded on 
CARLA-Simulator. CUSANI takes images generated by CARLA-Simulator ("Original Images") and the corresponding JSON files and generates new images with 2D bounding boxes on every object(pedestrians and vehicles) described in JSON file, these images are called "Treated Images".

On the above image, the corresponding original Image and JSON file are shown bellow.
